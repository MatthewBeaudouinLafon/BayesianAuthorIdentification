And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it�I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen. 
And Edward never would be. 
When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. 
It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream� but also my worst nightmare. 
I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. 
I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran�I would not think of it as me�was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. 
Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. 
His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. 
Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know�someone like me�these similarities marked them for what they were. 
The sight of Alice waiting there�her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands�made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. 
I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck�a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop�and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. 
"Happy birthday, Bella!" 
"Shh!" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. 
She ignored me. "Do you want to open your present now or later?" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited.
