We decided to look at the word frequency of a text written by each of the authors that we chose. For the class, we made the author's name be the hypothesis and ddecided to store the word counts for the authors in a dicitonary. The word counts themselves are also dictionaries with the words as the key and the number of times that they appear in the text as the value. The Likelihood function takes in a word as the data and the author as the hypothesis. We use the author to find the word count within the class dictionary. From there, we return the number of times the word showed up in the author's text. Since not all of the words that we will be updating with will be in all of the different authors' word count, we decided to make a function within the class that checks if a word is in all of the authors' word count. With this information, we can decide whether or not to run Update with a given word in the sample text.
